    <h1>Tonic of Fullness</h1>
    <img src="../img/fullness-potion.jpg" alt="An orange tonic of fullness">
    <p>This potion is popular among those that need to travel long distances. It is tastier than hardtack, and more shelf stable than salted meat. Though its still not very pleasant so I only really recommend it for journeys that will last at least a month.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Mandrake</li>
        <li>Wheat</li>
        <li>Figwort</li>
        <li>Arrowroot</li>
        <li>Lacewing Flies</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind up all of the ingredients aside from the Lacewing Flies and add to the bottle.</li>
        <li>Remove the wings from the flies and place the flies into the bottle. You can save the wings for later if you'd like to make a potion of swiftness.</li>
        <li>Fill the bottle with water and recite the incantation "Ventriculus implet"</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Just like that, you have a potion that will keep you full for hours. The nutritional value isn't amazing but it will keep you alive. There isn't much variation for this potion, other than added some spices to make the flavor better.</p>
